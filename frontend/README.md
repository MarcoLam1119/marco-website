  - **App.jsx**: The main application component that includes the Header, Body, and Footer.
  - **components/**: Contains reusable components like `PhotoFrame`.
  - **assets/**: Contains static assets such as images and SVGs.
  - **main.jsx**: The entry point for the React application, rendering the App component.

## Getting Started

To run the frontend application, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the `frontend` directory and run:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the Development Server**: Start the development server with:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open in Browser**: Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in the terminal) to view the application.

## Linting
